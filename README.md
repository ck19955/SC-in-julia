# SC-in-julia
Scientific Computing in Julia

In this project, I plan to recreate a previous Scientific Computing project I had done and rewritting it in Julia. At the start of this project, I have little experience in writing in Julia and I believe this will help me understand the language. The original project involved many different coding techniques and should be interesting to translate. 

In addition, it will be useful to see the difference in speed between Julia and Python. One Julia's greatest selling points as a language is the speed in comparisson to languages such as python, R and such. Julia gets to speeds similar to that of C. This project will hopefully illustrate the speed of Julia given I write the code sensibly.
